# Local LLM

Welcome to the **Local LLM** repository!  

This repository serves as a central hub for my experiments and projects with **Local Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Each subfolder contains individual projects demonstrating different applications of LLMs, including text generation, image generation, and other AI-powered experiments.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- Keep all my local LLM experiments organized in one place.
- Track progress across different LLM projects.
- Share notebooks, code, and outputs for reference or collaboration.

## 📝 Usage

Each project folder contains its own README and instructions.  


**Note:** Due to the large file sizes, LLM model weights are not included in this repository. Instructions for downloading models from Hugging Face are provided directly in the code.
